## Important notes

- Small fixes and pull requests are possible but not guaranteed.
- You still need a valid license for Graphics Mill to use Photo Kiosk.
- Photo Kiosk has a reference to Graphics Mill 5.x. You can use a [copy from this repository](3rdPartyComponents/GraphicsMill), or you can find it in the download section on the [Graphics Mill web site](https://www.graphicsmill.com/downloads).


## How to build

Open [PhotoKiosk.sln](PhotoKiosk.sln) with all required settings and build what you need. Please note that GraphicsMill 5.x is not available as a NuGet package. So, the reference has been set manually.
